# Brenda Web Interface
> The goal of this project is to create a web interface for the Blender render farm software for [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/) known as [Brenda](https://github.com/jamesyonan/brenda).

# Web/NodeJS Framework
- [Sails](http://sailsjs.org)

# Wuh? What is Brenda?
- [Blender Cycles Cloud Render Farming Using AWS, Deadline and Brenda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkZ60lF-nKM) is a great introduction to the software.
- [James Yonan – Build Your Own Low-Cost Yet Highly Scalable Blender Render Farm (BConf 2013)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oqo383uviw)

# Resources
- [Brenda Pro Forum](http://brendapro.com/forum/) - A great resource to get started with Brenda.

# Inspiration

- [Brender](http://www.brender-farm.org/) - I believe this became Flamenco.
